```sql
CREATE TABLE public.posts
(
    id integer NOT NULL,
    author integer NOT NULL,
    posted_at timestamp without time zone NOT NULL,
    title text COLLATE pg_catalog."default" NOT NULL,
    text text COLLATE pg_catalog."default" NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT posts_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id)
)
```

### Environment variables
Create `config.env` file and setup the following variables:
```
db_user = *your_username*
db_pass = *your_password*
db_name = *your_database_name*
db_host = localhost
db_port = *postgres_server_port*
````

## Start 
Type the following code in the terminal:
```
go run .
```

## Send requests

```
http://localhost:8080/api/v1/
```
